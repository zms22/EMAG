# EMAG
This repository is for the final project in ECE 1259: Electromagnetics taught by Dr. Robert Kerestes at the Unviersity of Pittsburgh in the spring semester of 2022-2023 academic year.
The authors of this github are Zebulon Smith, Kyle Montrose, and Nicholas Genco


Capacitor_Simulation_Documentation_Final.mlx - Matlab Live Script documentation explaining the functionality of the Capacitor Statics Application developed by our team.
CapacitorStatics.mlapp - Matlab App used to simulate Capacitor behavior
Dielectric_Table.xlsx - REQUIRED FILE - file to store Dielectric Material properties for the CapacitorStatics App. This file must be stored in the same repository as the CapacitorStatics.mlapp file for the CapacitorStatics App to run
teamdoc.docs - Word Document write up on our project distribution and team work throughout our team.
Capacitor_Simulation_Documentation_Final.pdf - PDF copy of the Matlab Live Script documentation. This has the same content as the .mlx version of the file but display and functionality is poor.
CapacitorStatics.m - Rough draft of the code contained within our CapacitorStatics.mlapp. The code here is not up to date and is only included to show early work attempts at completion of our project.
EMAG_Capacitor_function_documentation_prototype.docs - Rough draft at documentation for the CapacitorStatics.m file. This is not up to date and is only included to show early work attempts at completion of our project.
